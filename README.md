# PreForget
## *I haven't officially signed nor released the app on the App Store yet (I will be doing that within this week)*

PreForget is an interactive macOS menu bar app that was designed to help users easily manage their tasks.

The user friendly UI/UX helps keep away the boredom while conditioning the user to feel positive emotions when doing something that is traditionally "boring."
